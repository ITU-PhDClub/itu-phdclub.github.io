# ITU PhD Club Website

frontpage for the ITU PhD Club. Uses [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate webpages.
Content is in the `content` folder. Sites are done in markdown. 

Some content can be initialized using hugo commands and templates in the `archetypes` folder. 
For Example to generate a new entry in the `board-members` folder in content write `hugo new --kind board-member board-members/name-of-person`.
