Now it's time to grow up and become a proper organisation. We have worked on a draft constitution for a while now and are ready to present it to the rest of the PhD's at ITU. With this we hope to achieve 3 things:
1. Establish the PhD Club as an organisation seperate from us, the people running it. This will allow us to get new membersa and also step down when we are done (*hopefully*) without the Club dissappearing with us
2. Gain authority and trustworthiness when dealing with other organisations. Specifically to have an organisational bank account as a voluntary organisation banks require that you have a constitution and a board
3. formalising rules in peace time. Nobody likes conflicts and figuring out how to deal with them while they are happening is a whole can of worms in and of itself. That's why it's a good idea to have procedures that dictate how decisions are made before conflicts happen

All in all we are very excited about becoming a proper club and hope to see all of you there at the event! There you will also find the draft constitution
