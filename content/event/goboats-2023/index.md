          #### Message
          Dear fellow PhDs,
          
          We are delighted to see that the university is full of life again after the summer. Hopefully, everyone is full of energy to start the coming semester. In this spirit, we organize a PhD social event on Saturday, 16th of September at 15:00. The idea is to sail through the city with GoBoats during the afternoon. We will arrange some drinks and snacks, but please bring something if you feel like it.
          
          With respect to the organization, please accept this invitation if you will be attending before Tuesday, 12th of September, so that we can book the GoBoat(s). Fortunately, there is budget for this event, so it is free of charge.
          We hope you are as excited for this event as we are, and hope to see you there!
          
          On behalf of the PhD Club committee,
          
          Best regards,
          
          Jaike van Twiller
