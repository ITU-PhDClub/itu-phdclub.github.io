summary: Join us for a cozy visit to the traditional Christmas Market at Kongens Nytorv
abstract: |
  We will meet at the information desk in the Atrium after the University Christmas Event and then go together to Kongens Nytorv to walk around and enjoy the sights and sounds.
  At the market it will be possible to keep warm with glÃ¶gg or hot cocoa together with roasted almonds, Ã¦bleskiver or whatever else offered by the stalls. There is also plenty of opportunity for gift-hunting with handicrafts, woolen knitwear or glass art. 
  At 17:15 there is a kayak Saint Lucy light parade in the canal at Nyhavn which we can watch

  After that we can walk to HÃ¸jbro Plads where Santa is until 18, so if you want a selfie with Santa or just whisper your most-wanted christmas gifts, there is also plenty of opportunity for that ðŸŽ…ðŸ¤¶

  Hope to see you there!
